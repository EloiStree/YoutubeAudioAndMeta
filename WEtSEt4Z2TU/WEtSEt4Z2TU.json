    "description": "I improve my fishing tool and after 72 hours of fishing around they are still running. I am testing on level 20 accounts on Pandaria carp fishes.\n(I still need to add feature like auto log out login in to avoid wow disconnection after hours of gaming. Will be for next time I have some time to improve the tool. So you need to do it manually every 5-8 hours.)",
