    "description": "Edit: This code is not good enough and is not well design. I have a better code now but did not published it. I let's the video online in case it can help someone.  \n---------------------\nHello, I realized how hard, and not document, this simple computation of finding the shortest line of two lines in 3D is. So here is a way that is not the best or the more clear ever but at least it is a start point if you need to do it.\n\nGist code:\nhttps://gist.github.com/EloiStree/033d59e2dbaa7801644c9a03d95eb266\n\nHope the code help you. \nMay the code be with you.",
