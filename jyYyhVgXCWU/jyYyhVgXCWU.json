    "description": "Download the app: https://openmacroinput.itch.io/world-of-warcraft\nDISCLAIMER: I have not been ban but ban is always a possibility .\nThank to Wow adding always new feature to facilitate the bots industry  -__-' ...\nYou can now auto-interact with object. So I changed my tool and now have a 95-100% fishing attempts catch rate on 8 accounts at the same time.\nThat ridiculous.    \nI usually do free application. But this one is too powerful to stay free.\n(The previous version stay free if you want)\n\nIn hope to be helpful, you can find this video that explain the principle of the application and how to configure your wow account to be able to auto-fish in world of warcraft.  \n\nHope you have fun not fishing.\nHave a great day.\nEloi",
